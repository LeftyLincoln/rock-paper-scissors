# Rock-Paper-Scissors 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

I built a website with the functionality for a user to play against a computer in two different games. The first game is the classic rock/paper/scissors, and the second is a more difficult game which adds to more "fighters" to the mix. These added fighters are the lizard, and alien, which add to the complexity of who can win with what. This allows a user to enter the website and play against a totally random computer opponent and allows the user to keep track of the overall score, and who won each game. 

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

A user would open the link to this github repository, then would fork the repositiory. Next they would click the green code, which allows them make a copy of the linked ssh key. The user would then open the terminal to the directory they want to install this, and run git clone (ssh key they copied). From there they would cd into the directory, and then run code . if using vs code to be up and running. 

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

The project was assigned Tuesday midday and is due Tues evening. I had a week to work on it, and was given hours during class time to make progress. I will be in week 6 of the first mod when the project is due.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

1. Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of: DRY JavaScript & event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- I worked to build a solid product that had DRY Javascript running inside, and event delegation in the proper way when needed. 
2. Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- By building my product to work alone on the data model first allowed me to seperate the two, and understand the difference. While challenging I could see this process as being necessary in future applications and will work to incorporate this into all that I do. 
3. Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust yourself to not rely on an outside “answer” to a logical challenge
- This project added a lot of layers of complexity, and I was responsible for the HTML, CSS, and Javascript to work in tandem together. I had to figure out our own way of breaking this project down into more manageable steps, and to problem solve over and over again how to get this to work on the data model, then display on the DOM, then connect them together. 


### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

Wins: 
 1. I have a fully functioning product that users can play with
 2. My data model was able to function seperate from the DOM and is my source of truth

Challenges:
 1. Connecting my data model to the DOM presented challenges
 2. Figuring out how to display, and hide certain elements given the order of things was challenging.
